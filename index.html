        <h3>Curb Impulse Spending</h3>
        <p class="post-meta">Posted on September 21, 2025</p>
        <p>Online shopping has really ramped up our impulse spending - you see something on social media, and you can often buy it within a few clicks. Presto! It’ll be at your doorstep in a day or two.</p>
        <p>So how do we curb this kind of impulse spending? First, take a breath. Notice when you’re about to buy something. Notice that it seems really easy, tempting, frictionless, rewarding. Breathe for a moment.</p>
        <p>Second, delay. Tell yourself you can buy it in a couple of days if you still want to (waiting a week is better, a month is even better!). This pause will often allow the urge to subside. Tell yourself that there’s no reason you need it right away, and that you can wait</p>
        <p>Third, think long-term. In the pause, remind yourself of how this kind of spending is going to impact your financial situation in the long term. Would you rather build up a good financial situation, or have one more thing in your life you have to find a place for? Remind yourself that you already have too much.</p>
        <p>Fourth, find another way to meet the need. What need is this impulse spending meeting for you? Maybe it’s the need for some kind of fun or reward. Maybe it’s comfort or beauty. Can you find another way to meet this need that’s enjoyable but also good for your long-term goals? For example, if you want reward, maybe soaking in a bath with a good book is rewarding, or going for a nice walk out in nature. Maybe getting on a call with your best friend, or tidying up, or taking care of a plant or a pet, or spending time with your child, or learning about something fascinating</p>
        <p>By the way, these same steps work for any kind of impulse habit: playing video games, social media, eating junk food, smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, etc</p>
